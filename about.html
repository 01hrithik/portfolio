        <p class="font-serif">
    Hi, I'm Hrithik Gorane, a passionate Front-End Developer with a keen eye for design and a deep love for crafting intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. My journey in web development began "a few years ago when I realized the power of combining creativity with technology", and since then, I’ve been dedicated to building websites that are not only visually appealing but also functional and efficient.

       <h1 class="font-extrabold font-serif">  My Expertise </h1>
         
        <p class="font-serif">
            I specialize in translating complex ideas into seamless, interactive experiences on the web. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve honed my skills in responsive design, ensuring that my creations look great on any device. I’m also experienced with modern frameworks like React or Angular/Vue, etc. and enjoy working with tools like Git, Sass, and Webpack to streamline development and maintain clean, efficient code.

        <p class="font-serif">
            I believe that great design is about more than just aesthetics—it's about understanding the user’s needs and delivering solutions that enhance their experience. I’m a firm advocate of clean, accessible code and enjoy working closely with designers and back-end developers to bring projects to life. Whether I’m working on a small personal project or a large-scale application, I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.
